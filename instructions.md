2. Add three to four lines sharing a unique insight or personal experience.
3. Add one to two lines framing the topic for professionals.
4. Include three bullet points, each starting with "-" and each concrete, specific, and actionable.
5. End with a memorable, clear closing line.

Constraints:
- Be concise and brief. Under {MAX_WORD_LIMIT} words.
- No emojis, buzzwords, or filler.
- Short, punchy sentences.
- Avoid generic statements; provide depth and originality.
